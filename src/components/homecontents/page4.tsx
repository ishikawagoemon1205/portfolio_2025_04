                    While studying architecture in university, I founded my first business in 2020 driven by a strong desire to "achieve something only I can do, in the most efficient way." I launched a customer referral service that gained traction and even won a business competition.
                    However, I quickly realized the challenges of sustainability and trust-building in running a company. This experience led me to recognize the power of engineering as a way to independently create and deliver value.
                    Since then, Iâ€™ve devoted myself to acquiring technical skills and building hands-on experience in software development. My passion for creating things evolved into a full commitment to the world of technology and product development.
